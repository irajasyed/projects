RJCOPY - The Fastest File Copy System 
====================
Developed using python
====================

About this app,

If we want to copy an file/folder without knowing the location of that file/folder, then we have to do search which 
may take long time to find a location of the file/folder in windows. So this Application reduces that tension. It has 
certain algorithms to perform search in less than 2 seconds.

By this app, we can easily find a required file/folder with their attributes within 2 or 3 seconds and then we can copy 
the file into the location we desired.By default Destination directory is Parent directory of this software.

Features:
 *  Faster copy than normal windows GUI ( based on ROBUST COPY)
 *  Fastest Search
 *  Flexible GUI
 * "ENTER" key to perform search 
 *  File and Folder Copy
 *  Multiple Copy at a time

Instruction:
 1)Gather information about the Files at first boot ( It may take upto 20 seconds at first time only)
 2)We can perform search up to the updation of Info_file.
 3)Whenever application starts updation of file information will be start automatically.
 4)To perform search Click "Search" button or simply press "Enter".
